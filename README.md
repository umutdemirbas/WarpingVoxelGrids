# Warping Voxel-grids for 3D Robotic Mapping

This repo is for the "Warping Voxel Grids for 3D Robotic Mapping" Project at ETH ZÃ¼rich, 3D Vision class. The repo mainly focuses on mesh side of the project. For the integrated ORB-SLAM3 & Voxblox pipeline, see the submodule

## Overview

The mesh_edit directory contains the implementation of the Laplacian mesh editing algorithm as well as the mesh reconstruction process. The mesh_raycast directory comprises the source code responsible for locating corresponding points within the keyframes on the mesh.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umutdemirbas/WarpingVoxelGrids.git
cd WarpingVoxelGrids
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

### Data

Download the data for raycasting from https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/ndRrw4RKSGrBcPF and place into the `data` folder
